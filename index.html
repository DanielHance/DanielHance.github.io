                Spirits Unbound is a third person open world game set in a world based on Native American tribes, the game was created in ue5 by a team
                of 11 people (8 artists and 3 programmers). The game involves exploring the open world, defeating enemy tribes, changing the weather with
                rituals, hunting animals and discovering secrets. A key aspect of the game is that every human character has a spirite animal which their
                soul is connected to, in gameplay terms this means that they share heath and can both attack targets.

                I took on the role of lead programmer in the group which meant I was responsible for distributing all of the programming tasks, overseeing
                the technical design document and managing source control for the project. The areas of the game that I was responsible for programming were
                the enemy AI and the multiple animal companions AI (this can be seen in the AI test video above). I also worked on a lot of odd jobs including
                triggers, player combat, hunting and helping the other programmer with some of their tasks. For more info check pages 7 to 11 of the technical
                design doc.

                Duo to the hardware we had available the map and the game mechanics were created in diffrent ue5 projects, I was also reasonable for moving
                the assets between the dev project and the main game project and dealing with all the errors that this process created.

                My physics engine can simulate both static and dynamic sphere movement, the dynamic simulates both directional and rotational movement
                using velocity, friction, weight, elasticity and gravity as well as handling collision responses with the floor and other spheres.
                The physical properties of the spheres can be edited in an external text document to create a wide range of situations to simulate.
                The whole physics engine is built on top of an existing graphcis engine built using openGL.

                This basic 3d game was made entirely from scratch using OpenGL and SDL2, the aim of this project was to wrap the OpenGL elements into
                classes to create a graphics library that could be used to create basic 3d games without needing to use raw OpenGL code. The program is
                capable of both perspective and orthographic projections and renders the scene to an OpenGL render texture which allows multiple postprocessing
                shaders to be ran before the scene is pushed to the display buffer. The game itself is an endless scroller where you doge zombies which was made
                to demo the graphics library.

                I am currently working on creating a multithreaded raytracer which supports PBR, shadows and reflections on sphere and other regular polyhedron.
                I am also working on my own c++ game engine using the OpenGL, OpenAL, SDL2 and Bullet which I plan on using to create a FPS game.

            <p>
                My current long term project is to create a CAD tool for creating roller coaster track layouts and then simulating a roller coaster going round the 
                generated track. This will be created in a modified version of my game engine and use B-Splines to edit the layout of the track, however this 
                project is still only in the research phase so aspects of it might change.

                I am currently a third year student in my final year a Bournemouth university studying games software engineering. Outside of education I spend a lot of 
                time playing both video and board games with my favourites being Titanfall 2, Go, Minecraft and any multiplayer horror  games. Besides game my other 
                hobbies include listening to music, watching anime and reading manga.
